Fake News Detection Model

• Tech Stack: Python, pandas, scikit-learn & Jupyter Notebook.

• Text Vectorization: The cleaned text data is converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to prepare it for machine learning models.

• Model Training: Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, are trained on the vectorized text data.
